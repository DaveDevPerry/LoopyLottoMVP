## Motivation

<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists. -->

I first designed the loopy lotto in excel and played it at work with colleagues. Then I started to learn web development so it made sense that I coded it up. It was my first project using Javascript and during the development process I also learnt SASS.
I now play among family and friends.
